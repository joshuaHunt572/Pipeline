You are a classification engine.

Input:
FACTS:
{json.dumps(facts, indent=2)}

UNKNOWN ITEMS:
{json.dumps(unknown, indent=2)}

Task:
Classify the information into THREE categories:
1. tasks (actionable items)
2. events (time-bound or scheduled)
3. notes (informational, non-actionable)

Rules:
- Output JSON ONLY
- Do not invent information
- If unsure, place the item in notes
- Tasks must include: task, priority (low|medium|high), status
- Events must include: event, date (or "TBD"), type
- Notes are plain strings

Output schema:
{{
  "tasks": [...],
  "events": [...],
  "notes": [...]
}}
